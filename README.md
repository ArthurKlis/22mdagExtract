Python script to create a catalog of all the movies from the 22nd edition of Millennium Docs Against Gravity

A script to gather information about all the films from the 22nd edition of Millennium Docs Against Gravity—just because the festival organizers don't provide a single catalog of all the edition's films for download.
For this to work, you need to download the website from https://mdag.pl/22/pl/warszawa/movies and save it as '22mdag.html' - a single webpage file.
The script generates text files for each movie individually, making it easy to assess the desire to watch them without being influenced solely by the trailers. There are nearly 180 of them.

I like film festivals. Unfortunately, they don't offer a quick way to get familiar with the films and assess them. Not to mention that one edition of New Horizons festival, with all its movies, amounted to 91 pages of A4 containing a structured table of text.

The first publicly released code by me that was written almost entirely by artificial intelligence — Copilot by Microsoft. If not for the limit of around 10,000 characters, it would have been possible to complete this using AI in under 15 minutes, a task I wouldn't have been able to accomplish myself in that time, despite having the necessary skills in this area. Time is of the essence, whether you're prompting or coding.
